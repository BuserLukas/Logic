As long as their own knight is present, there is no danger, for their master protects them.  If their own knight is not with them, however, one of the other knights might try to kill them. The squires wouldn't harm each other.  For their own safety, each of the three squires follows their own knight at every turn. But when the group of six comes to a river, there is a problem:  There is a small boat on the shore, but it can only carry two people. The boat cannot change sides alone, it must always be rowed by at least one person.  How do the three knights and three squires make it safely to the other side?  \n",
